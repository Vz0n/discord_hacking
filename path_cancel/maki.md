## PUT -> DELETE -> PUT -> ... is a funny chain

It's a multi-purpose bot owned by Quare CommV. Has various functions just like Dyno and Sapphire and also an [API](https://api.maki.gg/docs), so other developers can interact with the bot.

As the other bots, this has the function to create a menu for role selection with reactions:

This request is sent by `POST` to the API endpoint `/guilds/:guild_id/role_selection` when you create one (removing useless fields):

```json
{
    "channel_id":"<Snowflake>",
    "unique":"<Boolean>",
    "reactions":[
        {
            "emoji":"<String>",
            "roles":"Array<Snowflake>",
            "random_roles_amount":"<Integer>",
            "mode":"OneOf<'toggle'|'add'|...>"
        }
    ],
    "components":"Array<DiscordV2Component>"
}
```

I tried to play with the `reactions[n].emoji` field and I saw that adding an `/@me#` at the end or `./` at the beginning won't change the request behaviour. So it's being part of the path of a request to this endpoint:

> **Create reaction** 
>
> `PUT /channels/{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}/reactions/{emoji.id}/@me`
>
> Create a reaction for the message. This endpoint requires the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission to be present on the current user. Additionally, if nobody else has reacted to the message using this emoji, this endpoint requires the `ADD_REACTIONS` permission to be present on the current user. Returns a 204 empty response on success. Fires a Message Reaction Add Gateway event. The `emoji` must be URL Encoded or the request will fail with `10014: Unknown Emoji`. To use custom emoji, you must encode it in the format `name:id` with the emoji name and emoji id.

I tried to go back to the API root with `../../../../../` and try to pin a message, but I got a catch... there was a 60 characters limit.

The `../../../../../` are already 15 characters. An snowflake already takes $[18,19]$ characters, and the words `channels` and `messages` takes $2*8 = 16$ characters, so if we assume that everything is maximized we have $2(19) + 15 + 16 = 69$ (multiply by two as we need to put two snowflakes)

There is a deprecated endpoint to pin messages (`/channels/{channel.id}/pins/{message.id}`). With that we take away $8$ characters from the value (the word `messages`), and as we are on channels already, we can remove a `../` and the `channels` word, so we remove $11$ characters and, $2(19) + 4 = 42$

Good, but we can't give roles ourselves as the url is too large (three snowflakes, `guilds`, `members`, `roles`: $3x + 6 + 7 + 5 \geq 60$). Nonetheless I noticed something, and it was that the backend removes the previous emoji if it was modified, even if Maki was not able to create the reaction; you can put something like `aadasd` and firstly it will throw a `500 Internal Server Error`, but after that it will go ok, and if you modify it, it will throw the error again, in summary the server was doing this:

I can also control the path of the `DELETE` request, so by reviewing lengths, I could do this (note that $x$ is the ID length and the other number is the total path length without counting the snowflake):

- Make the bot leave a guild, `../../../../../users/@me/guilds/{guild.id}#` ($x + 33 \leq 52$)
- Delete channels, `../../../../{channel.id}#` ($x + 13 \leq 32$)
- Unpin messages (the same as pinning a message)
- Delete messages, `../../../../{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}#` ($x + y + 23 \leq 60$ only if the channel $x$ or the message $y$ was created before 2022)
- Delete invites, `../../../../../invites/{invite.id}#` ($x + 24 \leq 49$)
- Delete application assets, `../../../../../applications/{application.id}/assets/{asset.key}#` ($x + y + 35 \leq 60$ only if the asset $y$ key has 4 characters or less)
- Delete forum tags, `../../../../{channel.id}/tags/{tag.id}#` ($x + y + 19 \leq 57$)
- Delete stage instances, `../../../../../stage-instances/{channel.id}# ` ($x + 32 \leq 51$)
- Delete store listings, `../../../../../store/listings/{listing.id}#` ($x + 31 \leq 50$)
- Delete webhooks, `../../../../../webhooks/{webhook.id}#` ($x + 25 \leq 44$)

The devs fixed the bug real quick after I reported it.
